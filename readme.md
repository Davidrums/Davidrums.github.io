# My personal blog

This is my personal blog where i leave all my interesting tidbits.

## Developing

You need to have `hugo` installed to work on this blog

First clone the repo and its submodules.
Then use `hugo serve -D` to serve the website locally and see the drafts.

## Deploying

The website is hosted using github pages and is automatically built using github actions.
All commits to master automatically trigger a new build of the production website.
