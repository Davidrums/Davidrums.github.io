title: "Pragmatic thinking and learning"
summary: "My observations while reading the book 'Pragmatic thinking and learning' by Andy Hunt"
---

I got to reading this book just after I finished preparations for my talk on reliability patterns.
I had been looking for the next book to read after finishing "Release it!" by Michael T. Nygard.

I have chosen this book so that I may become a better student and may some day attain the skills to become a bonafide expert in the field of Site Reliability Engineering.
